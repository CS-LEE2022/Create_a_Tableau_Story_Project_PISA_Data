# Create a Tableau Story Project_PISA Data


For this project, I am creating PISA data visualization using Tableau that tells a story in a data set. This work is a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

# Summary


[**PISA**](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/keyfindings/pisa-2012-results.htm) is a worldwide study developed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which examines the skills of 15-year-old school students around the world.

The study assesses students‚Äô **_mathematics_**, **_science_**, and **_reading_** skills and contains a wealth of information on students‚Äô background, their school and the organisation of education systems.

The current work selectively focuses on the impact of some key factors on **scholastic performance**, including countries, gender, apparatus number, programming skill,
to illustrate the wide range of possible analysis and visualisation tools that can be used with PISA and value will be placed on participants that are able to creatively use the strengths of the PISA dataset to submit creative analyses within one of the two areas identified. 

According to the visualization, high **scholastic performance** was seen in **_East Asia_**, **_North America_**, **_Europe_** and **_South Pacific_**. Moreover, **apparatus** seems to play a positive role in **scholastic performance**, whereas **programming** skills are trivial in terms of scholastic median score. Both **apparatus** and **programming** suggest positive relationships correlated with wealth.

# Design

- Firstly, with the help of geographic function in Tableau, **scholastic performance** was able to be presented in the world map;
- Secondly, table with numbers and lines were introduced to examine and highlighted the specific parameters, such as apparatus number, programming skill, for their effects on scholastic performance;
- Finally, bar charts were applied to further examine the relationship between either apparatus or programming skills with wealth;
- The user could interact with the map, numbers and lines from the chart.

# Feedback

`1.` For the relationship between programming skill and **_scholastic performance_**, line chart gives concise and better visualization than bar chart.


`2.`  Secondly, more investigation should be performed, such that the relationship either apparatus or programming skills with wealth.


`3.`  Add a story title at the top. On your first slide, the way the map cuts the Americas in half feels awkward.  If you drag the map to the side to put the split in the middle of the Atlantic or Pacific, I think it visually feels a lot better.  Also, the red and green you're using won't be distinguishable to a RG color blind person, so consider another color scheme. On slide two, edit the labels to say "Cellular Phone" or "Computers" instead of "cellular_phone_number" or "computers_number".  It will look cleaner that way. On the programming skills slide, I only see a blue line, and if I change which skill level I'm looking at in the drop down menu, it only shows one color at a time. Can you get all the colored lines on the graphs at once to highlight the point that there's no difference between the levels and score?  Also, consider rotating your graph to put the independent variable (country) on the X-axis and the dependent variable (score) on the Y-axis. On the last two slides, I'm not sure what the unit on wealth is.  What does zero represent?  What does a -2 wealth score mean?
